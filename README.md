# pyquilt

This repo is simply a collection of projects and programs I have written using pyQuil, a Python library built on top of Quil, which uses Forest, offered by Rigetti Computing (see more [here](http://forest.rigetti.com/)). Any interesting code which may be of use will be documented below (if I succeed in making any!)
